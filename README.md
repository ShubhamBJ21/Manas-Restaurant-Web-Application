5. **Validation**: Validates user input and ensures data integrity.
6. **Listener**: Listens for application and session events.
7. **FileIO**: Handles file operations such as reading and writing.

## Role: Backend Development
This documentation focuses on the backend development aspect, which includes implementing business logic, database operations, validation, and data handling.
